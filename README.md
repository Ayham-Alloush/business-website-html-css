# Business Website (HTML, CSS)

## Overview

This repository contains a static, multi-section website, developed using only HTML and CSS. The project is a faithful replication of a provided design prototype, focusing on showcasing business services, team members, testimonials, and contact information in a clean and responsive layout.

## Purpose

This project was undertaken as part of a remote training exercise with **ProCoders**, where the primary goal was to accurately clone a given design prototype using fundamental front-end technologies. It served as a comprehensive practice to:

* **Master HTML5 Structure:** Build a complex, multi-section web page with semantic and well-organized HTML.
* **Advanced CSS3 Styling & Layout:** Apply intricate CSS techniques for precise styling, responsive layouts (e.g., Flexbox/Grid for sections like "What We Do," "Our Team"), and visual fidelity to the prototype.
* **Implement Responsive Design:** Ensure the website adapts seamlessly and is fully functional across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) without relying on external frameworks.
* **Attention to Detail:** Develop the ability to translate a visual design into pixel-perfect web code.

## Features

* **Hero Section:** Engaging introductory area with a clear call to action.
* **About Section:** Provides an overview of the business or project.
* **Services Section ("What We Do"):** Highlights key offerings with descriptive cards.
* **Team Showcase:** Presents team members with images and social links (visual only).
* **Testimonials:** Displays customer feedback in a clean, organized manner.
* **Contact Form (Design Only):** Includes the visual layout for a "Request a Call Back" form and a map integration (design only).
* **Newsletter Subscription (Design Only):** Visual form for email subscription.
* **Footer:** Contains useful links, contact information, and social media icons (visual only).
* **Fully Responsive:** The entire website layout adjusts to provide an optimal viewing experience on all devices.
* **Pure HTML/CSS:** Achieves a sophisticated design and responsiveness without the aid of JavaScript or CSS frameworks.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring all content elements and sections of the multi-page layout.
* **CSS3:** Applied extensively for all visual styling, custom layouts, responsive adaptations, typography, and color schemes, ensuring an accurate replication of the prototype.
